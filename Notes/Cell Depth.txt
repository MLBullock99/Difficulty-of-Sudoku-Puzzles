Generally, an easier puzzle has more possible steps that lead to progress at a given time
All cells that can be filled in using only the initial cells can also be filled in at any time during the solve
The more cells that can be filled in initially, the easier the first part of the puzzle is

Assign a 'depth' to each cell:
- Initial cells are depth 0
- Cells that can filled using only depth 0 cells are depth 1
- Cells that can be filled using only depth 0 and 1 cells are depth 2
- So on until the puzzle is solved

The higher the max depth, the more linear the puzzle is, making it harder
The more cells of depth 1 (and low depths?), the more options available in the solve, making it easier
