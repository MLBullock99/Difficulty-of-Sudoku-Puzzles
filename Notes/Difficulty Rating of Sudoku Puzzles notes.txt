- Sudoku puzzle can be viewed as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem
- Also can be viewed as a special case of a graph colouring problem
  - Puzzle is finding a 9-colouring given the initial assignment

- Approaches for solving sudokus:
  - Backtracking:
    - Basic approach to solving CSPs
    - 'Trial and Error', doesn't represent how humans solve
    - Exponential time complexity, but 9x9 puzzles can be solved easily
  - Constraint Propagation:
    - For each square, define candidate set as values that don't directly break constraints
    - Not guaranteed to find a solution
    - May more efficient than backtracking
    - Natural way humans solve sudokus

- Use mean solution time as a measure of difficulty for humans
  - Noted high correlation between mean and median in data set
