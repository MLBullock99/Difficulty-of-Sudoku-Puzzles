- Sudoku puzzle can be viewed as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem
- Also can be viewed as a special case of a graph colouring problem
  - Puzzle is finding a 9-colouring given the initial assignment

- Approaches for solving sudokus:
  - Backtracking:
    - Basic approach to solving CSPs
    - 'Trial and Error', doesn't represent how humans solve
    - Exponential time complexity, but 9x9 puzzles can be solved easily
  - Constraint Propagation:
    - For each square, define candidate set as values that don't directly break constraints
    - Not guaranteed to find a solution
    - May more efficient than backtracking
    - Natural way humans solve sudokus

- Use mean solution time as a measure of difficulty for humans
  - Noted high correlation between mean and median in data set

- Model repeatedly:
  - Chooses simplest technique for current state that gives a result
  - Choose one of the actions that this technique can perform
  - Apply this action to give the new state
- Assumes solver doesn't make mistakes and progress is always possible with logic
- If an unknown technique is needed, trial and error is used to show which values are inconsistent
  - This uses breadth first search on a tree of possible actions
  - Sum of the depths is the refutation score
- Best correlation for medium difficulty puzzles

- Different metrics for evaluation:
  - Serate Metric:
    - Maximal difficulty technique used
  - Serate LM Metric:
    - Compute how many times each technique is used
    - Compute linear model with parameters generated from test data
  - Fowler's Metric:
    - Metric used by G. Fowler's tool
    - Complicated expression based on number of uses of each technique
  - Refutation Sum Metric:
    - Mean sum of refutation scores over a number of randomized runs

- Number of possibilities also affects difficulty
  - Computes the mean number of possibilities over first k steps

- Can generate sudoku graph
  - Vertices are squares
  - Edges if two squares can't have the same number
  - Problem is to find a 9-colouring of this graph
- Easy puzzles have more redundancy with connections, as they have more ways to the solution
- Randomly remove k edges from the sudoku graph
  - Might lose unique solution
  - If there still is a unique solution, then the puzzle has redundancy, so is easier
- Mean number of solutions grow exponentially with k
  - roughly c.exp(k/6), where c depends on the puzzle and is between 0.02 and 0.2
- Probability of a unique solution decreases nearly linearly with k
- Can also count number of fixed cells, cells with the same variable in each puzzle with k constraints removed
  - The number of fixed cells declines with k more slowly for easy problems
  - Fixedness of a cell is probability that a cell is fixed with k random constraints removed
  - Fixedness can be used to predict order of cell filling
    - Higher fixedness are filled earlier
