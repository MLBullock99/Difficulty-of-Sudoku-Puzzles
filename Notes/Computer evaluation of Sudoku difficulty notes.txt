- A program which aims to imitate how humans would solve a sudoku
  - Humans typically choose most obvious step rather than the most useful
  - Normally, more obvious steps are those that use simpler strategies
- Only uses the 4 simplest strategies, so wont be able to solve more complex sudokus
- Scoring system based off how many times the program has to switch strategies
  - Chose coefficients to make score similar to that of human test data
- If the program can't solve the sudoku, it determines score based off what proportion of the grid is empty at the end
- States main issue was small sample size of human test data
